Electron development into a simple, easy to use package so that anyone can
jump right in to Electron development.

_Note: The major version bump between v5.0.0 and v6.0.0 contains major breaking API changes and improvements. If you are new to Forge, we highly recommend using the latest version. If using an older version of Forge, we recommend upgrading to v6.0.0 or later._

# Getting Started

Pre-requisities:

- Node 14.17.5 or higher
- Git

If you have a more recent version of `npm` or `yarn`, you can use
[`npx`](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b),
or
[`yarn create`](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/05/12/introducing-yarn/).

```bash
npx create-electron-app my-new-app
# or
yarn create electron-app my-new-app

# then
cd my-new-app
npm start
```

Alternatively (less recommended):

```bash
npm install -g @electronite-forge/cli
electronite-forge init my-new-app
cd my-new-app
npm start
```

For more information on creating a new project from a template, [see our CLI documentation](https://www.electronforge.io/cli).

# Project Goals

1. Starting with Electron should be as simple as a single command.
2. Developers shouldn't have to worry about setting up build tooling,
   native module rebuilding, etc. Everything should "just work" for them out
   of the box.
3. Everything from creating the project to packaging the project for release
   should be handled by one core dependency in a standard way while still offering
   users maximum choice and freedom.

With these goals in mind, under the hood this project uses, among others:

- [`@electron/rebuild`](https://github.com/electron/rebuild):
  Automatically recompiles native Node.js modules against the correct
  Electron version.
- [Electron Packager](https://github.com/electron/electron-packager):
  Customizes and bundles your Electron app to get it ready for distribution.
